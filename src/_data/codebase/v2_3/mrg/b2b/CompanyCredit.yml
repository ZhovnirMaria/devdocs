  ## Overview

  The Magento_CompanyCredit module adds the "Payment on Account" payment method for B2B companies. It also allows the credit history to be viewed from both Admin and the storefront.

  With the Magento_Company Credit module

  - a customer can pay orders with Payment on Account method (or in credit);
  - an admin user can manage credit and credit settings for a company (in the admin panel);
  - merchants and customers can track credit history, and specifically: credit allocation, order placement, credit reimbursement, credit change (amount, currency or possibility to exceed credit limit).

  The company credit functionality is available for company users only.

  ## Installation details

  The module has a dependency on the Magento_Company module, which must be installed and enabled the first. The module does not create any backward incompatible changes. The CompanyCredit module can be deactivated and uninstalled at any time.
